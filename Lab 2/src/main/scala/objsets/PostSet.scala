/**
 * This represents a set of objects of type `Post` in the form of a binary search
 * tree. Every branch in the tree has two children (two `postset`s). There is an
 * invariant which always holds: for every branch `b`, all elements in the left
 * subtree are smaller than the post at `b`. The elements in the right subtree are
 * larger.
 *
 * Note that the above structure requires us to be able to compare two posts (we
 * need to be able to say which of two posts is larger, or if they are equal). In
 * this implementation, the equality / order of posts is based on the post's text
 * (see `def incl`). Hence, a `postset` could not contain two posts with the same
 * text from different users.
 *
 *
 * The advantage of representing sets as binary search trees is that the elements
 * of the set can be found quickly. If you want to learn more you can take a look
 * at the Wikipedia page [1], but this is not necessary in order to solve this
 * assignment.
